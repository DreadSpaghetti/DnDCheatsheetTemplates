### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.
#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.
#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus
+ your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.
#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.
#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Rune Knight
Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes,
an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among
any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from
such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or
cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the
giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.



### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smithâ€™s
tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.



### Rune Carver
Starting at 3rd level, you can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two
runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain
a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from
this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional
runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

##### Runes Known	
| Fighter Level | Number of Runes |
|:---:|:---:|
| 3rd | 2 |
| 7th | 3 |
| 10th | 4 |
| 15th | 5 |

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the
number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the
objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a
piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune
remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one
of your runes at a time.

The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a
level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune.
If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

#### Cloud Rune
This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or
carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an
attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different
creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature
becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the
attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Fire Rune
This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While
wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is
doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke
the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and
it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While
restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each
of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do
so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Frost Rune
This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness,
such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,
you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation)
checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness.
For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that
use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again
until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Stone Rune
This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While
wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on
Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you
can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom
saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1
minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is
incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you
invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher)
This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing
or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws
against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune,
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher)
Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing
or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence
(Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state
for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or
another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving
throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have
advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until
you finish a short or long rest.



### Giant's Might
At 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a
bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

- If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are
wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike
can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### Runic Shield
At 7th level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When
another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you
can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Great Stature
By 10th level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this
feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.

Moreover, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.



### Master of Runes
At 15th level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature
twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short
or long rest.



### Runic Juggernaut
At 18th level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a
result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10.

Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you
are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.
