### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.
#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.
#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus
+ your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.
#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.
#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Psi Warrior
Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their
physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of
mental force. Many githyanki train to become such warriors, as do some of the most
disciplined high elves. In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of
becoming Psi Warriors.

As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through solo
discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy
dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.



### Psionic Power
At 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This
energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a
number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various
psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a
power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when
your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when
you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended
Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice
increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

**Protective Field.** When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of
you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic Energy die, roll
the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence
modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic
force.

**Psionic Strike.** You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of
your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack
and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling
it and dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your
Intelligence modifier.

**Telekinetic Movement.** You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As
an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing
creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet
of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either
way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this
action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you
expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### Telekinetic Adept
By the 7th level, You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities,
detailed below.

**Psi-Powered Leap.** As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind.
You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the
current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you
finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

**Telekinetic Thrust.** When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike,
you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 +
your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the save fails, you can
knock the target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Guarded Mind
Starting at 10th level, the psionic energy flowing through you has bolstered your
mind. You have resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn
charmed or frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and end every effect on
yourself subjecting you to those conditions.



### Bulwark of Force
At 15th level, you can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a
bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see
within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by
half cover for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated.

Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long
rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.



### Telekinetic Master
By 18th level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched
by few. You can cast the Telekinesis spell, requiring no components, and your
spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you
concentrate on the spell, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one
attack with a weapon as a bonus action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to cast it again.
