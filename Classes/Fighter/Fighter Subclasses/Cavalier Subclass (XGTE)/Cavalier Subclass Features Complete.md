### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.
#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.
#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus
+ your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.
#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.
#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Cavalier
The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility
and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or
exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in
their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of
the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave
their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.



### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the
following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or
Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.



### Born to the Saddle
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage
on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount
and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if youâ€™re not
incapacitated.

Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement,
rather than half your speed.



### Unwavering Mark
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and
punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any
attack roll that doesn't target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you
can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus
action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits,
the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter
level.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a
number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain
all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### Warding Maneuver
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other
creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by
an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a
shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that
attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's
damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a
minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Hold the Line
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke
an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your
reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is
reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.



### Ferocious Charger
Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not.
If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature
and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw
(DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You
can use this feature only once on each of your turns.



### Vigilant Defender
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In
combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn,
except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity
attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.
