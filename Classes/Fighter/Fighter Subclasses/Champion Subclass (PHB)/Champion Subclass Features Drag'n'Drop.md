## Champion
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to
deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous
training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.



### Improved Critical
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
```
```
### Remarkable Athlete
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your
proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases
by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.
```
```
### Additional Fighting Style
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.
```
```
### Superior Critical
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
```
```
### Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each
of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you
have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you
have 0 hit points.
```
