### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.

#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.

#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Battle Master
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down
through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes
including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every
fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in
the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great
skill and knowledge.



### Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by
special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an
attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two
additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you
learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority
die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice
when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level
and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw
to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<div style="text-align: center">
**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity
modifier
(your choice)
</div>



### Student of War
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### Know Your Enemy
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with
another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its
capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal,
superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your
choice:

- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Fighter class levels (if any)



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Improved Combat Superiority
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into
d12s.



### Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice
remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.
