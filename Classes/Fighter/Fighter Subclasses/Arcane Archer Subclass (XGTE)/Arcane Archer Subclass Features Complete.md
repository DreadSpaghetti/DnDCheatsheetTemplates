### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.

#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.

#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Arcane Archer
An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into
attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite
warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping
a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and
invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of
these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance
arcane aptitude with archery.



### Arcane Archer Lore
At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for
practitioners of of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in
either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the
Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip.



### Arcane Shot
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots.
When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see
"Arcane Shot Options" below).

Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack
action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to
use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll.
You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you
finish a short or long rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain
levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when
you become an 18th-level fighter.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### Magic Arrow
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a
nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose
of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic
fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.



### Curving Shot
At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you
make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll
the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Ever-Ready Shot
Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If
you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of
it.



### Arcane Shot Options
The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options
are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one 
is associated with one of the schools of magic.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

**Banishing Arrow.** You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your
target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also
succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its
speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target
reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
occupied.

After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when
the arrow hits it.

**Beguiling Arrow.** Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile
its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and
choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next
turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals
damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

**Bursting Arrow.** You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of
evocation. The arrow detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits
the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force
damage each.

The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

**Enfeebling Arrow.** You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit
by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until
the start of your next turn.

The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

**Grasping Arrow.** When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates
grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the
arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes
2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without
teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to
remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane
Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option
again.

The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level
in this class.

**Piercing Arrow.** You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal
quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack.
Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long,
before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover.
Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing
damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

**Seeking Arrow.** Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek
out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its
prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack.
Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward
that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover
and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large
enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an
extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful
save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.

The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

**Shadow Arrow.** You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude
your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6
psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see
anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
