### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Blind Fighting (optional tcoe)
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively
see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature
successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2
bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception (optional tcoe)
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 +
your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a
simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of
you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.

#### Superior Technique (optional tcoe)
You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master
archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to
resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.) You gain one superiority die,
which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another
source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when
you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
rest.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting (optional tcoe)
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make
with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown
weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.

#### Unarmed Fighting (optional tcoe)
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the
attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal
1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.



### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 +
your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again.



### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment.
On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it
again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.



## Eldritch Knight
The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters
with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to
those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of
magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at
once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively 
small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a
spellbook.



### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast
spells.

#### Cantrips
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an
additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots
The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a
2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose
from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you
learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an
abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you
have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn
one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you
know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must
be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or
evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or
20th level from any school of magic.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn
your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.

{{text-align:center
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
}}



### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one
weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a
short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the
conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon
unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon
that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your
hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your
bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond
with one of the other two.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

#### Martial Versatility (optional tcoe)
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement
feature, you can do one of the following, as you shift the focus of your martial
practice:

- Replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters.
- If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Master archetype, you can replace one
maneuver you know with a different maneuver.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and
to four when you reach 20th level in this class.



### War Magic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one
weapon attack as a bonus action.



### Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so,
you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three
times between long rests starting at 17th level.



### Eldritch Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's
resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that
creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast
before the end of your next turn.



### Arcane Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space
you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the
additional action.



### Improved War Magic
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one
weapon attack as a bonus action.
