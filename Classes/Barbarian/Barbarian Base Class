### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits ifyou
aren't wearing heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain leveis as a barbarian, as shown
in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you ean't cast them or
concentrate on tbem while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. lt ends early if you are
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
can rage again.



### Unarmoured Defence
While you are not wearing any armour, your Armour Class
equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
modifier. Vou can use a shield and still gain this
benefit.



### Reckless Attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
for defence to attack with fierce desperation. When
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turn.



### Danger Sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.
Vou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
against effects that you can see, sue h as traps and
spells.To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded,
deafened, or incapacitated.



### Primal Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.



### Primal Knowledge (optional tcoe)  
When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, 
you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from 
the list of skills available to barbarians at 1st level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level. you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this
feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up 
not being very useful in the campaign or that no longer
fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to 
your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with 
another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st 
level. A convenient time for such a change is when 
you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score 
Increase feature, representing that your character 
has spent a level or two studying the new skill and 
letting the old one atrophy.



### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.



### Fast Movement
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you aren't wearing heavy armour.

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
combat and aren't incapacitated. you can act normally
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
doing anything else on that turn.



### Instinctive Pounce (optional tcoe) 
As part of the bonus action you take to enter your 
rage, you can move up to half your speed.



### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level
and three additional dice at 17th level.

despite grievous wounds. lf you drop to 0 hit points

a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. lf you succeed. you
drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first. the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.
