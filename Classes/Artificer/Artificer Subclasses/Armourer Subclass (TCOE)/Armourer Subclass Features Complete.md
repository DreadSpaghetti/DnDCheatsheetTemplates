#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per artificer level<br>
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields<br>
**Weapons:** Simple weapons<br>
**Tools:** Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice<br>
**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence<br>
**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand

#### Firearm Proficiency (optional tcoe)
The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D
multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the Dungeon Master's
Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your
artificer is proficient with them.



### Magical Tinkering
At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To
use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then
touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical
properties of your choice:

- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5
feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard
up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the
object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind,
waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a
picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as
you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and
end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this
feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. 
The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). 
If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the
new property applies.



### Spellcasting
You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic
through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a
conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish
inventions.

#### Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a
spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand
when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M"
component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this
way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these
tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item
bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

#### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At
higher levels, you learn additional artificer can trips of your choice, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips
you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer
spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend
a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing
from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells
equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down
(minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two
2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can
include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot.
Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a
new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting
focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your
understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with
superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.

<div style="text-align: center">
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you
have the spell prepared.



### Infuse Item
At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical
infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn
additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as
shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer
infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with
one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on
only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the
item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the
item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal
process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion
vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1
day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum
number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You
must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object
at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If
you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and
then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its
contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.



### Armourer
An artificer who specializes as an Armourer modifies armour to function almost like a
second skin. The armour is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, unleash potent
attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armour,
becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical
capabilities.



### Tools of the Trade
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy
armour. You also gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this tool
proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your
choice.



### Armourer Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach
particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armourer Spells table. These spells
count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of
artificer spells you prepare.

##### Armourer Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | *Magic Missile, Thunderwave* |
| 5th | *Mirror Image, Shatter* |
| 9th | *Hypnotic Pattern, Lightning Bolt* |
| 13th | *Fire Shield, Greater Invisibilty* |
| 17th | *Passwall, Wall of Force* |



### Arcane Armour
Beginning at 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armour a
conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armour you are wearing
into Arcane Armour, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armour:

- If the armour normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armour lacks this
requirement for you.
- You can use the arcane armour as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
- The armour attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands
to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus
action. The armour replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part
it is replacing.
- You can doff or don the armour as an action. The armour continues to be Arcane
Armour until you don another suit of armour or you die.



### Armour Model
Beginning at 3rd level, you can customize your Arcane Armour. When you do so, choose
one of the following armour models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose
gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add
your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and
damage rolls.

You can change the armour's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided
you have smith's tools in hand.

***Guardian.*** You design your armour to be in the front line of conflict. It has
the following features:<br><br>
**Thunder Gauntlets.** Each of the armour's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon
while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A
creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other
than you until the start of your next turn, as the armour magically emits a
distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.<br>
**Defensive Field.** As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to
your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You
lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armour. You can use this bonus action
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***Infiltrator.*** You customize your armour for subtle
undertakings. It has the following features:<br><br>
**Lightning Launcher.** A gemlike node appears on one of your armoured fists or on
the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of
90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit.
Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6
lightning damage to that target.<br>
**Powered Steps.** Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.<br>
**Dampening Field.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armour
normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel
each other, as normal.



### The Right Tool for the Job
At 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves'
tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools
in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of
uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product
of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.



### Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the
Attack action on your turn.



### Tool Expertise
At 6th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make
that uses your proficiency with a tool.



### Flash of Genius
At 7th level, you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure.
When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check
or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the
roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



### Armour Modifications
At 9th level, you learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your
Arcane Armour. That armour now counts as separate items for the purposes of your
Infuse Items feature: armour (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armour's
special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions
transfer over if you change your armour's model with the Armour Model feature. In
addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but
those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armour.



### Magic Item Adept
When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and
make magic items:

- You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
- If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a
quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.



### Spell-Storing Item
At 11th level, you can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long
rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a
spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a lst- or 2nd-level spell
from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it
prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect
from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires
concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until
it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.



### Magic Item Savant
At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

- You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- You ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.



### Perfected Armour
At 15th level, your Arcane Armour gains additional benefits based on its model, as
shown below.

**Guardian.** When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30
feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a
Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet
toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of
you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

**Infiltrator.** Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning
Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The
glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on
attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the
next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes
an extra 1d6 lightning damage.



### Magic Item Master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune up to six magic items at once.



### Soul of Artifice
At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can
draw on for protection:

You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction
to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of
0.
