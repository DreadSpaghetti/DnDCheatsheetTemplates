This is a repository of the necessary markup used to create nice and simple cheat sheets for D&D fifth edition characters.

Just copy-paste the text directly into the homebrewery (https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new),
while making the necessary changes every so often,
to start making an oh-so-easy cheat sheet custom made for your character.


Apart from all the necessary race/class/background/etc information, you will need to use a lot of \<br>, \\page, and \&nbsp; tags
as well as the odd:

\<style>
  .phb{
    width : 210mm;
    height : 296.8mm;
  }
\</style>

and

\<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>
\<div style='margin-top:6px'></div>

and

\<div style="text-align: center">
\</div>


blocks.
