This is a repository of the necessary markdown used to create nice and simple cheat sheets for D&D fifth edition characters.
\
\
Just copy-paste the text directly into the homebrewery (https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new),
while making the necessary changes every so often,
to start making an oh-so-easy cheat sheet custom made for your character.
\
\
Apart from all the necessary race/class/background/etc information, you will need to input your own ```\column``` and ```\page``` tags
as well as ensuring that you have the renderor set to V3 in "Properties", and that you have:

```
.phb {
	width  : 210mm;
	height : 296.8mm;
}
```
written in the "Style Editor" section.

Enjoy!!!
