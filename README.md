# DnDCheatsheetTemplates

This is a repository of the necessary markdown used to create nice and simple cheat sheets for D&D fifth edition characters.
\
\
Just copy-paste the text directly into the homebrewery (https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new),
while making the necessary changes every so often,
to start making an oh-so-easy cheat sheet custom made for your character.
\
\
Apart from all the necessary race/class/background/etc information, you will need to input your own ```\column``` and ```\page``` tags
as well as ensuring that you have the renderor set to V3 in "Properties", and that you have:

```
.phb {
	width  : 210mm;
	height : 296.8mm;
}
```
written in the "Style Editor" section.
\
\
\
This repository contains character options from:
\
\
The Player's Handbook\
The Dungeon Master's Guide\
Elemental Evil Player's Companion\
The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide\
Xanathar's Guide To Everything\
Volo's Guide To Monsters\
Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes\
Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica\
and\
Tasha's Cauldron of Everything\
\
I will not be adding any options from third-party or unofficial sources (Such as Critical Role, Adventure Zone, or Unearthed Aracana), and I will only be adding the official options as I purchase the physical copies of each sourcebook.\
\
That being said, the base class/race/whatever files are available so that if you want to add information from some of the afore-mentioned omitted sources, or wanted to make cheatsheets for your own homebrew stuff, you are free to do so with relatively little hassle\
\
If you have any questions or queries or just want to have a chat you can message me on reddit. My username is u/PhonyMaccaroni74

Enjoy!!!
