get all the basic subclass features down for all of the classes.

change up complete subclass feature things (class table/subclass table, anything else that may be there)

go through and fix any spacing errors still lurking around (races and classes).

fix up all the information so far into v3 format (races and classes). (make a separate branch for this)

put spell lists into order based on sourcebook. (make a separate branch for this)

start on races again. (go in book order, it'll just be easier)

find all subclasses that have multiple sources and add other sources if slight difference (e.g sun soul monk)
