## Elves
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal
beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie
light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the
breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

### Elf Features
Your elf character has the following features.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the
elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly
experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100
and can live to be 750 years old.

**Alignment.** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean
strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom
as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their
exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often
evil than not.

**Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your
size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as
if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern
color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and
magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining
semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance."
While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental
exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this
way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.

#### Eladrin Traits

When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might
choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most
closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin
might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to
winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become
an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

**Fey Step.** As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until
you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an
additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the
DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The effects are as
follows:

**Autumn.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your
choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage
to it.

**Winter.** When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can
see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Spring.** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5
feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an
unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

**Summer.** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice
that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1 damage).
