## Aasimar
Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from
humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful
good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed
as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features
that reveal their celestial heritage.

An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being.
That being – usually a deva – provides guidance to the aasimar, though this
connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or
a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.
