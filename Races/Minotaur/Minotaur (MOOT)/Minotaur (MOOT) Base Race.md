## Minotaur
Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. 
Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. 
They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.
